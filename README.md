# Bookish App

Bookish is an app that allows you to catalogue and organize the books in your life.

As a lifelong reader, I have always struggled with trying to keep track of all of the books I have read, want to read, want to buy and already own. I also wanted to be able to further organize books into personally meaningful collections. This is my attempt at solving that problem!
